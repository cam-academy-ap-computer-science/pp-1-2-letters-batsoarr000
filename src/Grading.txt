Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

You did not have blank lines between the letters,
so I took off one point for that.

You'll also notice that you forgot an end-line in your
Aunt letter, so the last line is up next to your previous
line with no space.  I took off one additional point for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the methods that
were letters and the methods that were shared paragraphs.
